## About The Project

<!-- [![EduLit][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->

Covid-19 has had a huge impact in the field of education. Many students have faced difficulties in understanding online classes and it has been hard for teachers to deliver to their standards. Online classes have taken over the concept of physical classes but with a low productivity for teachers in explaining and for students in understanding the class. Traditionally, teachers share screen and use the whiteboard to write and explain using their physical mouse. This not only affects students attention span, but also hinders the teaching quality. 

Inorder to tackle this, we have developed an application where teacher can create a room and invite students into his class. In this app, the teacher in his live video feed can write notes in real time using his fingers. We try to bring back the physical whiteboard writing into reality. This live video feed is then broadcasted to all the students in the room. Therefore, students while maintaining the eye contact with the teacher, can look over the written material bringing them closer to the physical classroom setup.
